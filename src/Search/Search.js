// TODO 2.4. Make sure the class field that stores all pokemons is updated after pokemon data is fetched (which lifecycle method can be used here?).
// TODO 2.5. For now, we need to have this component rendering a single div with SearchResults component inside of it.
// TODO      Let’s pass pokemons array from  Search’s state and the information, whether data has been fetched already or not to Search Results.
